  # M13-Ecommerce-Back-End

  ## Description
  Ecommerce Back End is a server database allowing the user to make get, post, put, and delete requests. It was made for practice with ORM's and Sequelize. During this project I learned to:
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete on a database using just JS

  - Use get, pull, put, and delete requests with mySQL create, read, update, and destroy

  - Create tables with relational mapping to other models.
